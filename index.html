          <h2>You are CHARLIE</h2>
          <img src="img/charlie.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
          <strong>Like Charlie you are...</strong>
          known for your illiteracy, your habit of slipping into a variety of characters for your various schemes, and your never ending obsession with The Waitress. Although you are by most respects the stupidest member of the Gang, you are capable of rare, impressive moments of brilliance, particularly with music and engineering complex social schemes.
          </p>

        <div id="mac">
          <h2>You are MAC</h2>
          <img src="img/mac.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
          <strong>Like Mac you are...</strong>
          obsessed with being tough and looking like a badass. You constantly seeks acceptance of your parents, but your over-earnest efforts make you come off as an asshole. Due to your inflated and fragile self-image, you are riddled with insecurities and often place great pressure on yourself to look superior or not fail at anything. Consequentially, when given an unwanted position, you will attempt to use it to glamourise yourself.
          </p>

        </div>
        <div id="dee">
          <h2>You are DEE</h2>
          <img src="img/dee.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
          <strong>Like Dee you...</strong>
          identify yourself as a compassionate and liberal, you are self-centered, vain, careless, and often holds the same prejudices as the rest of the Gang. You have a very tall, lanky, and often clumsy frame for which you're appearance is frequently compared to that of a bird.
          </p>

        </div>
        <div id="dennis">
          <h2>You are DENNIS</h2>
          <img src="img/dennis.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
          <strong>Like Dennis you are...</strong>
          extremely vain, selfish, superficial, hypersexual, and delusional about yourself. You also have an extreme temper and will blow up in rage whenever your image is called into question, you don't get what you want, or are just plain irritated.
          </p>

        </div>
        <div id="frank">
          <h2>You are FRANK</h2>
          <img src="img/frank.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
          <strong>Like Frank you are...</strong>
          a successful businessman and has a long history of illegal operations and diabolical schemes. You  claims to have your friend's best interests at heart but frequently exploits and insults them.
          </p>

        </div>
        <div id="cricket">
          <h2>You are CRICKET</h2>
          <img src="img/cricket.png" alt="" />
          <p>
          <strong>Like Cricket you...</strong>
          have steadily spiraled down over the years thanks to the actions of the Gang: leaving the priesthood, becoming homeless, various drug addictions (namely cocaine and crack), having your throat slashed, and having the left side of your face covered in burns.
